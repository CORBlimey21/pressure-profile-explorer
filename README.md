Pressure Profile Explorer

Overview

Pressure Profile Explorer is a Streamlit app designed to help students discover their pressure profile based on their extracurricular and academic hours outside of school. By entering weekly extracurricular hours and daily academic hours, users can compare their schedules with real student data and receive insights into their pressure levels.

Features

Pressure Profile Determination: Based on the input hours for extracurricular and academic activities, the app provides a pressure profile (e.g., "Stretched Achiever", "Well-Rounded Learner", etc.).
Activity Pressure Comparison: Users can compare their pressure from selected activities with their overall time-based pressure.
Student Data Analysis: The app uses a dataset of students' extracurricular and academic hours to identify similar profiles and offer personalized feedback.
How It Works

Input Sliders: Users input their weekly extracurricular hours and daily academic hours via sliders.
Profile Determination: Based on these inputs, the app calculates the user's pressure profile and provides traits associated with that profile.
Activity Selection: Users can select extracurricular activities they participate in. The app compares the pressure generated by their activities with their time-based pressure.
Data Visualization: The app visualizes the distribution of student profiles using a pie chart.
Installation

Data

The app uses a dataset (2and5.csv) containing student data, which includes:

Weekly extracurricular hours
Daily homework hours
Pressure levels
The dataset is used to identify similar students and calculate an average pressure profile.

Features and Calculations

Profile Types: The app categorizes students into different profiles, including:
"Well-Rounded Learner"
"Stretched Achiever"
"Take-it-easy Explorer"
"Activity Adventurer"
"Academic Driver"
Pressure Traits: Each profile comes with a set of traits based on the user's time and activity commitments.
Activity Pressure: The app also compares pressure from selected activities (e.g., sports, music, art) with the overall pressure level derived from time commitments.
